# 📊 Sentiment Analysis Model

A **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** project that classifies text into **Positive, Negative, or Neutral** sentiments. It uses **text preprocessing, TF-IDF feature extraction, and a Naive Bayes classifier** for sentiment classification.

This project is built with a modular structure, making it easy to extend with more advanced models like **LSTM, BERT, or RoBERTa**.

-----

## 🚀 Features

  * **Text Preprocessing:** Includes tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
  * **Feature Extraction:** Utilizes **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
  * **Sentiment Classification:** Employs **Multinomial Naive Bayes** for classification.
  * **Modular Codebase:** Designed for easy extension and integration.
  * **Flexible Usage:** Supports command-line interface (CLI) predictions and can be deployed as an API or web application.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
    cd sentiment-analysis
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Linux/Mac
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🏃 Usage

### 1\. Train the Model

```bash
python src/model.py
```

### 2\. Predict Sentiment from CLI

```bash
python src/predict.py --text "I love this project!"
```

**Output:**

```
Sentiment: Positive
```

### 3\. Run API / Web App

```bash
python app.py
```

Then, open your browser and navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

## 📊 Example Results

| Text | Predicted Sentiment |
| :--- | :--- |
| "This product is amazing\!" | Positive |
| "I really hate the service." | Negative |
| "The movie was okay." | Neutral |

## 📌 Future Improvements

  * Integrate deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, Transformers).
  * Deploy the application on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Hugging Face Spaces.
  * Build a user interface using a framework like React.
  * Add a real-time sentiment analysis API.
